# NCAA All-Sports Rosters 2025-26 — Release Notes

## v2.0.2 — 2026-07-14 (conference label normalization)

Cosmetic conference-label normalization on the public **19-column** tier. **No rows added
or removed** (515,085), **no schema change**, **no other field changed** — only six
conference spellings from different source feeds were normalized to their canonical
official names:

| Was | Now | Rows |
|---|---|---:|
| `Old Dominion Athletic Conf.` | `Old Dominion Athletic Conference` | 6,112 |
| `Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conf.` | `Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference` | 4,893 |
| `Southern Intercol. Ath. Conf.` | `Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference` | 4,083 |
| `Atlantic 10 conference` | `Atlantic 10 Conference` | 597 |
| `Sunbelt Conference` | `Sun Belt Conference` | 416 |
| `New England Wrestling Assn` | `New England Wrestling Association` | 28 |

`Southern Conference` (D1) and `Southern Athletic Association` (D3) are **left distinct** —
they are genuinely different leagues. DOI **10.57967/hf/9512** (cite with version **2.0.2**).

## v2.0.1 — 2026-07-13 (label correction)

Conference/division label corrections on the public **19-column** tier after a full
**2025-26** re-verify. **Schema unchanged.**

| | v2.0 | v2.0.1 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Athletes | 515,393 | **515,085** |
| Schools | 1,089 | 1,089 |
| Public columns | 19 | 19 |

### Why −308 athletes

**Louisiana Christian University** (NAIA) roster rows had been mixed into the Louisiana /
UL Lafayette scrape path via `lcwildcats.net`. Those **308** rows are removed. No other
schools were dropped for this release.

### What else changed

- **Conference labels** corrected for 2025-26 vintage: stale realignment names and
  core-collision / join errors filled or fixed. Conference is now populated for
  **≈99.97%** of rows (empty only where intentional — see below).
- **Division labels** corrected where mislabeled; public `division` is the authoritative
  D1/D2/D3 field.
- **`by_sport/`** convenience slices rebuilt from the corrected master (203 CSVs;
  gender×division leaves still sum to the full master).

### Known intentional exceptions (not bugs)

| Case | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Shawnee State** | Empty `conference` (172 rows). NCAA D2 member competing as NAIA in 2025-26 — no NCAA conference affiliation that year. |
| **Independents** | `Independent` is correct for full independents including **Notre Dame**, **Maranatha Baptist**, and **Salem WV**, and for athletes on sport-specific independent schedules. |

### Unchanged

- De-identification posture (no names).
- Public column set and semantics.
- DOI **10.57967/hf/9512** (cite with version **2.0.1**).

## v2.0 — 2026-07-08

Individual-level roster data for **all 28 NCAA championship/emerging sports**, all three
divisions (D1/D2/D3), both genders, athletic year **2025-26** — the first year under the
House v. NCAA settlement (roster limits, revenue sharing, NIL).

- **515,393 athletes** across **1,089 schools** (~91.8% of officially reported NCAA
  participations; 96.9% of sponsor-list teams; 98.5% of D1).
- **De-identified** (no names, no contact info). Every field is an institution-published
  roster fact from official college athletics sites, validated against NCAA sponsor lists.
- **Public tier:** 19 columns. **Analysis tier:** 54 columns (adds Census town income,
  high-school public/private/religious classification, College Scorecard / mobility joins) —
  research-only; not distributed in this GitHub tree.
